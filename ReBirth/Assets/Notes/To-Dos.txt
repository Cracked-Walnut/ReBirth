--------------------------------------GAME DEV TO-DO LIST--------------------------------------

Tasks Haven't Started:
	- Cinemachine:
		- Get Cinemachine Virtual Camera to point to other objects
		- Get Cinemachine Virtual Camera to stay within a set of boundaries
	- Roll Animation and Logic
		- If continuining to roll, keep moving in desired direction regardless of horizontal input
		- increase speed while rolling
	- Slide Animation and Logic
	- Change CircleCollider to BoxCollider

Bugs Haven't Started:
	- Holding crouch while rolling slows the player to crouch speed
	- Jumping while rolling makes the player jump
	- Roll should perist if player lets go of horizontal keys
	- Rolling while rolling :'D
	- Rolling off a ledge should perist rolling animation

			- Idle [X]
			- Run [X]
			- Crouch [X]
			- Wall Slide [X]
			- Wall Climb [X]
			- Jump (Up & Down) [X]
			- Roll
	Bugs:

	Tasks:
		- Animation for when player stops running
		- Turn Around animation
			- Run -> Turn Around -> Run
			- Might need to modify Idle conditional statements [Horizontal Move]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished:
	Tasks:
		- Animations (Slice Sprite sheets):
			- Idle [X]
			- Run [X]
			- All Crouches [X]
			- Wall Slide [X]
			- Jump (Up & Down) [X]
		- Double Jump [X]
		- Player Animation Tree
			- Attach Animator object to PlayerMovement.cs [X]
			- Idle [X]
			- Run [X]
			- Crouch [X]
			- Jump (Up & Down) [X]
			- Wall Slide [X]
		- Reset Double Jump upon mid-air wall contact [X]
		- Wall Slide code
		- Dust animation on jump
		- Wall Climb Animation
		- Variable Jump
		- Refine Wall Slide
			- Add an extra WallCheck
			- If Both WallChecks are true, initiate Wall Slide
				- If Top is false and Bottom is true, don't do anything
				- If Top is true and Bottom is false, don't do anything
		- Dust Effect upon Wall Jump
		- Play Jump_Up animation while Wall Jumping
			- The player is Wall Jumping if their Y velocity is > 5 and both Wall Check is true
		- CanMove boolean
		- Crouch -> Idle when exiting tight space while not holding Crouch
			- Check PlayerMovement.cs Crouch() for fix
		- Add Wall Jump Multiplier float variable
		- Add Dust Effect to rolling

	Bugs:
		- Going into crouch activates wall slide animation, otherwise works fine
		- Infinite double jump
		- Wall jump is too strong
			- Only initial jump is strong
				- Find the source
				- Hypothesis: Wall Jump and Double Jump jump force are being added before jump [Correct!]
		- If crouching while falling off ledge, animation will not properly cycle
		- If wall sliding, wall slide animation persists when holding run keys when grounded [Added Trigger from Wall_Slide -> Run]
		- Jump height not high enough [Fixed some values in the scripts and Rigidbody2D Component]
		- Jump Up to Idle transition problem [Added Trigger from Jump_Up -> Idle]
		- If either Wall Check is true, double jump doesn't work [fixed by checking if double jump is true and (WallCheckTop OR WallCheckBottom)]
		- When either Wall Check is true when wall sliding, the player model flips [fixed by playing around with some conditional statements in PlayerAnimation.cs]
		- The player is stuck in the Wall Slide animation when either Wall Check is true [fixed by changing some animation conditions between Wall_Slide and Jump_up]
		- Sometimes, after a wall jump, wall jump force and double jump force are applied simultaneously 
			- [This bug is much more difficult to test. The code is written. I will assume it's fixed unless I see the bug again]
			- To Double Jump, Both Wall Checks must be false
		- After double jumping, Jump_Down animation plays even when Y velocity exceeds 0
			- I think it's because Jump_Up is only applied to the first jump!
				- Wrong! I fixed it by adding a transition from Jump_Down to Jump_Up
		- When Wall Sliding to the ground, player doesn't flip
			- Modified some conditionals to fix
		- After a wall jump, small chance to land on the ground during Jump_Up animation.
			- There is no transition out of this animation, so the player is stuck in Jump_Up [tough to test for, but I've added a transition from Jump_Up -> Running]
		- Holding crouch in mid-air slows the player to crouch speed

Things to keep in mind:
	- DustEffect's sorting layer is Player, Sorting ID is -5
