--------------------------------------GAME DEV TO-DO LIST--------------------------------------

Haven't Started:
	- Jump Buffer code
		- Check your previous repositories
	- Key Frame Collision Boxes
		- Idle
		- Run
		- Crouch
		- Wall Slide
		- Wall Climb
		- Jump (Up & Down)
	- Cinemachine:
		- Get Cinemachine Virtual Camera to point to other objects
		- Get Cinemachine Virtual Camera to stay within a set of boundaries
	- Wall Climb Logic
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGtlja1RStk
	- Wall Jump Animation of some kind
	- Increased Wall Slide speed if player is holding the down key while wall sliding
		- Wall Slide boolean?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs:
	- Player is wall sliding while only bottom wall check is active
	- When wall jumping and coming into contact with another layer, player switches X axis while mainting Wall Slide animation
		- Since at least one of the Wall Checks is true, there is no animation transition
		- The sprite flips because we're checking for BOTH Wall Checks

Started but Paused:

In Progress:
	- Refine Wall Slide
		- Add an extra WallCheck
		- If Both WallChecks are true, initiate Wall Slide
			- If Top is false and Bottom is true, don't do anything
			- If Top is true and Bottom is false, don't do anything

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished:
	Tasks:
		- Animations (Slice Sprite sheets):
			- Idle [X]
			- Run [X]
			- All Crouches [X]
			- Wall Slide [X]
			- Jump (Up & Down) [X]
		- Double Jump [X]
		- Player Animation Tree
			- Attach Animator object to PlayerMovement.cs [X]
			- Idle [X]
			- Run [X]
			- Crouch [X]
			- Jump (Up & Down) [X]
			- Wall Slide [X]
		- Reset Double Jump upon mid-air wall contact [X]
		- Wall Slide code
		- Dust animation
		- Wall Climb Animation
		- Variable Jump

	Bugs:
		- Going into crouch activates wall slide animation, otherwise works fine
		- Infinite double jump
		- Wall jump is too strong
			- Only initial jump is strong
				- Find the source
				- Hypothesis: Wall Jump and Double Jump jump force are being added before jump [Correct!]
		- If crouching while falling off ledge, animation will not properly cycle
		- If wall sliding, wall slide animation persists when holding run keys when grounded [Added Trigger from Wall_Slide -> Run]
		- Jump height not high enough [Fixed some values in the scripts and Rigidbody2D Component]
		- Jump Up to Idle transition problem [Added Trigger from Jump_Up -> Idle]

Things to keep in mind:
	- DustEffect's sorting layer is Player, Sorting ID is -5
