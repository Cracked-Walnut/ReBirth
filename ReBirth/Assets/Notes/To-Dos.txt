				- priority
			- Set up camera confiner
				- Polygon Collider 2D around stage
		- Mid-air dash (upgrade, add to notes)
		- Maintain roll momentum when rolling off ledge
			- You'll need to find a way to persist rolling animation
			- Fixed by including an extra condition for Jump_Down animation
		- Implement _isWallSliding boolean?
		- Text Dialogue Logic
		- Wall Jump Buffer
			- Should be similar to Jump Buffer code
			- Try to use wall touching booleans as conditions
		- Add Kill Boxes
		- PlayerAttack:
			- Instantiate knife when left click is pressed
				- Projectile moves in direction player is facing until:
					- it hits an enemy or it touches a wall or projectile timer drops below 0 seconds
				- If player is wall sliding, choose different attack point [X]
				- Check attack cool down and can attack
		- Death animations
			- Ghoul
			- Spitter
			- Summoner
		- Hit Effect:
			- on non-enemy
				- wall
			- on enemy
		- Increase Wall Slide Speed
		- Enemies need "hit taken" animation
			- Ghoul
			- Spitter
			- Summoner
		- Coin Interaction
			- Player touches coin, coin counter increases, coin is destroyed
		- Bullet must break walls
		- Enemy AI:
			- Ghoul
				Slowly walks in a pattern. Engages when player gets too close. [X]
				Spawn out of the ground when player approaches
					- Make a small radius around Ghoul
						- If player falls into radius, Spawn -> Walk
					- Trouble setting State to Walk after Spawn
			- Spitter
				Stationary. Spits deadly poison at player when sighted.
					- New Bullet Script?
						- Bullet.cs
							-> Knife.cs
							-> FireBall.cs
					- Create FireBall prefab
					- Change events in Knife prefab
			- Shielder
				- Acts as a shield for enemies
					- Make a radius that checks for enemy layer
						- If enemy is found, that means enemy is alive, which means a shield should be applied
						- Make sure enemy isn't another Shielder, though
							- To do this, check the name of the enemy
				- Must be killed first
				- If enemies are within its shield radius, grab the enemy's EnemyLife script and turn on _isShielded bool to true
				- In Bullet/Knife script, when grabbing EnemyLife, first check if enemy is shielded before applying damage
				- There is currently NO ALTERNATIVE WAY of breaking a shield. The only way to break a shield is to kill the Shielder...
					-... who may have a primitive AoE attack as a defense

				- Modify EnemyLife to have Shield variable

	Bugs:
		- Going into crouch activates wall slide animation, otherwise works fine
		- Infinite double jump
		- Wall jump is too strong
			- Only initial jump is strong
				- Find the source
				- Hypothesis: Wall Jump and Double Jump jump force are being added before jump [Correct!]
		- If crouching while falling off ledge, animation will not properly cycle
		- If wall sliding, wall slide animation persists when holding run keys when grounded [Added Trigger from Wall_Slide -> Run]
		- Jump height not high enough [Fixed some values in the scripts and Rigidbody2D Component]
		- Jump Up to Idle transition problem [Added Trigger from Jump_Up -> Idle]
		- If either Wall Check is true, double jump doesn't work [fixed by checking if double jump is true and (WallCheckTop OR WallCheckBottom)]
		- When either Wall Check is true when wall sliding, the player model flips [fixed by playing around with some conditional statements in PlayerAnimation.cs]
		- The player is stuck in the Wall Slide animation when either Wall Check is true [fixed by changing some animation conditions between Wall_Slide and Jump_up]
		- Sometimes, after a wall jump, wall jump force and double jump force are applied simultaneously 
			- [This bug is much more difficult to test. The code is written. I will assume it's fixed unless I see the bug again]
			- To Double Jump, Both Wall Checks must be false
		- After double jumping, Jump_Down animation plays even when Y velocity exceeds 0
			- I think it's because Jump_Up is only applied to the first jump!
				- Wrong! I fixed it by adding a transition from Jump_Down to Jump_Up
		- When Wall Sliding to the ground, player doesn't flip
			- Modified some conditionals to fix
		- After a wall jump, small chance to land on the ground during Jump_Up animation.
			- There is no transition out of this animation, so the player is stuck in Jump_Up [tough to test for, but I've added a transition from Jump_Up -> Running]
		- Holding crouch in mid-air slows the player to crouch speed
		- Holding crouch while rolling slows the player to crouch speed
		- Roll should perist if player lets go of horizontal keys
		- rolling while crouched under a platform
		- jump buffer launches you into the air
		- isRolling not set to false if rolling anim cut short
			- animations that can cut roll anim short:
				- rolling off a ledge: jump_down anim
				- [future bug?] taking damage: damage anim
		- Dashing into a corner will launch the player upwards [reverse terminal velocity wasn't working]
		- Rolling into a crouchable area doesn't transition gracefully to Crouch
			- Fixed by removing animation connection from Roll to Run
		- Can roll through walls with good timing
			- Fixed by editing roll collision box
		- After wall jumping, infinite jumping until velocity.y < 0
			- Fixed by putting condition outside of velocity.y check
		- Double Jump sometimes triggers when trying to wall jump
			- Fixed by tweaking wall slide condition in PlayerMovement.cs
		- Both of these fixed by commenting out the extra jump input condition on line 231 in PlayerMovement.cs
			- Double Jump and Jump Buffer are being executed at the same time
			- walking off a ledge and jumping doesn't work
		- WallJumpBuffer and Double Jump functions running at the same time
			- Fixed by removing an extra jump input from the WallJumpBuffer condition
		- Knives go through wall
			- Fixed with Rigidbody2D (I think)
		- While wall sliding and holding the crouch button, upon reaching the ground the player does not enter the appropriate animation
		- Ghoul will not die from Knife
		- Blue screen in game window when game is running
			- Spitter enemies had Camera object attached to them
		- Protector shield stays active after Protector is dead
			- You're only destroying the Sprite object in the Protector hierarchy!
			- EnemyLife.cs doesn't work on Protector's parent object
			- [Fixed]: Got rid of child objects and brought everything into the parent

Archived:
	Tasks:
		- Enemy Visual Life Bars:
			- Becomes visible when damaged
			- Green for HP; red for lost HP
		- Enemy Tally:
			- Use separate Tags for each enemy?
				- Sort by Tags so incrementing is easiest
				- new script for player
					- EnemyTally
				- EnemyLife will reference MonsterTally
				- You're gonna need a Singleton GameObject that keeps track of all enemies alive
					- Knows then they're dead, and can update things accordingly
					- Check your Github
		- Animation for when player stops running
		- Turn Around animation
			- Run -> Turn Around -> Run
			- Might need to modify Idle conditional statements [Horizontal Move]
		- Slide Animation and Logic
		- Wall Climb Logic
			- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGtlja1RStk
			- Use two Raycasts to detect a ledge to climb
				- 2nd raycast will look for ground to climb
			- If 1st is false and 2nd is true
			- Player stays put, animation plays, move player to new position
		- Ledge Jump
			- Shoot 2 Raycasts
		- Refactoring Phase 1:
			- Combine the Buffer functions
				- Double Jump isn't working
				- Wall Jump Buffer isn't working

	Bugs:

Notes:
	- Replace player character?
		- Knife attack may be too powerful

Things to keep in mind:
	- DustEffect's sorting layer is Player, Sorting ID is -5

	- Among Virtual Cameras, the one with the highest priority takes precedence
		- There is no checkbox system to prioritize cameras. Only priority values
		- Make VirtualCamera1 the highest values (like... 100 by default)
			- Set all other cameras -1 values from the previous virtual camera,
				then manipulate priority values as you see fit
		- The camera with the highest priority will take precedence
		- Use a Camera Script to control the camera pointed at the player
			- Otherwise, if camera references are being invoked in many scripts,
				it would be a problem to debug

	- When placing Protectors, make sure no enemies are within its shield radius
		- Otherwise, shield activation will not work
