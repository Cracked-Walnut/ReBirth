--------------------------------------GAME DEV TO-DO LIST--------------------------------------

Tasks Haven't Started:
	- Jump Buffer code
		- Check your previous repositories
	- Key Frame Collision Boxes
		- Idle
		- Run
		- Crouch
		- Wall Slide
		- Wall Climb
		- Jump (Up & Down)
	- Cinemachine:
		- Get Cinemachine Virtual Camera to point to other objects
		- Get Cinemachine Virtual Camera to stay within a set of boundaries
	- Wall Climb Logic
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGtlja1RStk
	- Increased Wall Slide speed if player is holding the down key while wall sliding
		- Wall Slide boolean?
	- CanMove boolean
		- Should disable/ enable:
			- Horizontal Movement [Running + Crouch Movement]
			- Jumping
			- Attacking
			- Crouching
	- Animation for when player stops running
	- Play Jump_Up animation while Wall Jumping
		- The player is Wall Jumping if their Y velocity is > 0 and either Wall Check is true

Bugs Haven't Started:
	- When Wall Sliding to the ground, player doesn't flip

Started but Paused:
	Tasks:
	Bugs:

In Progress:
	Tasks:
		- Turn Around animation
			- Run -> Turn Around -> Run
			- Might need to modify Idle conditional statements [Horizontal Move]
	Bugs:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished:
	Tasks:
		- Animations (Slice Sprite sheets):
			- Idle [X]
			- Run [X]
			- All Crouches [X]
			- Wall Slide [X]
			- Jump (Up & Down) [X]
		- Double Jump [X]
		- Player Animation Tree
			- Attach Animator object to PlayerMovement.cs [X]
			- Idle [X]
			- Run [X]
			- Crouch [X]
			- Jump (Up & Down) [X]
			- Wall Slide [X]
		- Reset Double Jump upon mid-air wall contact [X]
		- Wall Slide code
		- Dust animation on jump
		- Wall Climb Animation
		- Variable Jump
		- Refine Wall Slide
			- Add an extra WallCheck
			- If Both WallChecks are true, initiate Wall Slide
				- If Top is false and Bottom is true, don't do anything
				- If Top is true and Bottom is false, don't do anything
		- Dust Effect upon Wall Jump

	Bugs:
		- Going into crouch activates wall slide animation, otherwise works fine
		- Infinite double jump
		- Wall jump is too strong
			- Only initial jump is strong
				- Find the source
				- Hypothesis: Wall Jump and Double Jump jump force are being added before jump [Correct!]
		- If crouching while falling off ledge, animation will not properly cycle
		- If wall sliding, wall slide animation persists when holding run keys when grounded [Added Trigger from Wall_Slide -> Run]
		- Jump height not high enough [Fixed some values in the scripts and Rigidbody2D Component]
		- Jump Up to Idle transition problem [Added Trigger from Jump_Up -> Idle]
		- If either Wall Check is true, double jump doesn't work [fixed by checking if double jump is true and (WallCheckTop OR WallCheckBottom)]
		- When either Wall Check is true when wall sliding, the player model flips [fixed by playing around with some conditional statements in PlayerAnimation.cs]
		- The player is stuck in the Wall Slide animation when either Wall Check is true [fixed by changing some animation conditions between Wall_Slide and Jump_up]
		- Sometimes, after a wall jump, wall jump force and double jump force are applied simultaneously 
			- [This bug is much more difficult to test. The code is written. I will assume it's fixed unless I see the bug again]
			- To Double Jump, Both Wall Checks must be false
		- After double jumping, Jump_Down animation plays even when Y velocity exceeds 0
			- I think it's because Jump_Up is only applied to the first jump!
				- Wrong! I fixed it by adding a transition from Jump_Down to Jump_Up


Things to keep in mind:
	- DustEffect's sorting layer is Player, Sorting ID is -5
