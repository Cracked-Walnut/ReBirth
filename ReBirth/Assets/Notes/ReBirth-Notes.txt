    ...
    Long ago, the Seal was shattered.
    ...
    An evil emerged.
    ...
    ...
    With the letter you've received, you ventured to these lands with the intent of investigating.
    ...

Game Loop:
    Fight through a region of the world. Come across locked and unlocked doors. Discover bosses. Trade with

(Spoilers) Deeper Story:
    The Seal is an interdimensional rift created by the King's lineage to experiment with finding new life. These prospects would be expected to serve
    the Royal Family in times of war.

    This matter quickly got out of hand, and sparked the largest conflict in recent history. The world was torn. The kingdoms of the world, turned to dust.

    Generations passed. People started to rebuild. Many moved on to brighter pastures. Some stayed in hopes a change would come.

                1) I smith. That's my job. That's all I've known.
                    Now, are you gonna show me your sword?
                2) Things haven't changed a whole lot for me after the Hex Affliction.

            Rumour(s):
                1) They say there's a cave nearby. Could hold some valuable stuff.
                    ...
                    Reaching it is another matter, I'm afraid.
                    ...
                    For a bit of coin, I could mark it on your map. What do you say?
                        Yes:
                            - The blacksmith put a red mark on your map.
                        No:
                            - No? Alright, then. But I might hand it over to another traveller if you're not around, hehe.
                            ...
                            I'm afraid I run a first come, first served style of business.


            Finish:
                1) Stay safe out there.
                2) Done? Be on your way, now.

Code Design:
    - How can I build a system that involves invoking animations at will for game objects?
        - Scrap the State system
        - Invoke animation triggers without a State script as the middle-man

        - Use Triggers to invoke animations. Within animations, invoke SetMovementSpeed() function to manipulate movement
        so correct animation could play
